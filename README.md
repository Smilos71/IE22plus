# IE22+ | !!PLS READ!!

## Description
In 2022, support for Internet Explorer ended forever, and now when you open it, you will be automatically redirected to Microsoft Edge. IE22+ bypasses this redirect, so you can use it without problems. 

## Functions
- Opens Internet Explorer without redirecting to Microsoft Edge.


## How to use
1. Download the `IE22+.vbs` file to your computer from [here](https://github.com/Smilos71/IE22plus/releases/tag/download).
2. Drag the `IE22+.vbs` file to the desktop
3. Run the `IE22+.vbs` file and open Internet Explorer as needed.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.
- Windows 7 or later.

## What to do if it doesn't work
It may happen that you open a file and instead of a web page, the window screen is white. To fix this, open a new tab and close the old one.

## Important Security Warning
Do NOT log in to any of your accounts (Google, Microsoft, etc.) while using Internet Explorer, as it is no longer secured. Internet Explorer was officially discontinued in 2022, and continuing to use it for logging into accounts can expose your personal information to security risks.
